Board for potted ring generator module. Mounts in 70mm Tyco Track (MD) inputs power (screw term and barrel jack), output, straps to select frequency,
optionally add pads for other varieties. The modules are long since MD and data sheets are not available for the PCR-SIN01=V12F00A which I bought oneBay
some suppliers claim to have them.
